## System Architecture
### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React 18 with TypeScript, adhering to a modern component-based architecture. It utilizes `shadcn/ui` for a consistent design system, `TanStack Query` for server state management, and `React Hook Form` for form state. Routing is handled by `Wouter`, and styling is managed with `Tailwind CSS` using custom theme variables. `Vite` is used for fast development and optimized builds. Firebase Authentication is integrated for user authentication.

### Backend Architecture
The backend follows a RESTful API design implemented with Express.js on Node.js and TypeScript. It includes middleware for CORS, session management, and file uploads. `Drizzle ORM` is used for type-safe database operations, and `multer` handles file uploads to the local file system. The API provides RESTful endpoints with comprehensive error handling.

### Database Architecture
The system uses a PostgreSQL database with a normalized schema design. Key areas include user management integrated with Firebase UIDs, comprehensive company profiles with geolocation data, a flexible membership system with various pricing options, and content management for categories, certificates, projects, and user opinions. Dynamic system configuration, including homepage settings, is also managed within the database.
